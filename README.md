## Quickstart

1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python 3.13+ from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   - Verify installation:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```

2. **Set up the development environment**
   - After pulling the latest changes, run the setup script to update dependencies and configure git hooks:
     ```sh
     bash scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
     ```
   - This script will automatically install Python dependencies and set up pre-commit hooks for code quality.

3. **Run the API locally**
   ```sh
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

4. **Access the interactive API docs**
   - Open [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs) in your browser for Swagger UI.
   - Or [http://localhost:8080/redoc](http://localhost:8080/redoc) for ReDoc.

## Development environment with VS Code

### Running Locally

- Open this folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
- Use the built-in debugger:
  - Press `F5` and select the "Run FastAPI (uvicorn)" or "Run FastAPI (fastapi run)" configuration from the dropdown.
  - The API will start and you can access the docs as above.
- You can also use the integrated terminal to run commands manually.
